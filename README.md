## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Highlights

* **Core Logic:** Implemented in `definitive_solar_analysis.py`, which performs robust data cleaning, theoretical modeling, and sequential loss attribution.
* **Data Sources:** Utilizes diverse sensor data including POA irradiance, inverter power, and ambient/module temperatures for comprehensive analysis.
* **Loss Attribution:** A sequential capping methodology ensures that the energy gap between theoretical and actual generation is fully and non-redundantly attributed to specific loss categories.
* **Flag Generation:** Boolean flags precisely indicate the presence of attributed losses, aligning with validator requirements.
* **Visualization:** Uses Plotly for rich, interactive web-based dashboards.
